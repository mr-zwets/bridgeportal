# Bridge Portal

Bridge Portal is an example front-end for bridging SBCH NFTs to CashTokens.

⚠️ The application is not functional as it needs to be linked to a bridging back-end server ⚠️

The application works similar to the [reapers-bridge](https://github.com/cashninjas/reapers-bridge) where you connect with MetaMask and send specific SBCH NFTs to the SBCH burn address to perform one-way bridging to CashTokens.
